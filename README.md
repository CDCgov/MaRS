# MaRS (Malaria Resistance Surveillance)

The emergence of resistance to all currently available antimalarial drugs in multiple regions of the world represents a current global public health challenge. In order to monitor and address this situation, faster and more effective surveillance tools are required to track and monitor the emergence and evolution of drug resistance in malaria. The Malaria Resistance Surveillance (MaRS) project aims to address this challenge by collating and mapping genetic polymorphisms associated with drug resistance in malaria around the world. The project achieves this by employing a targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) approach [Lab Protocol](https://github.com/CDCgov/MaRS/tree/master/lab_sop) to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms on all major malaria drug resistance genes associated genes in samples sourced from travelers returning to the US from overseas, as well as samples actively collected in collaboration with partners from other countries.

Data for this project can be found at the following link [NCBI BioProject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA428490). Collaborators are encouraged to submit their own data using this [NCBI BioProject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA428490)

The[NeST](https://github.com/CDCgov/NeST) analysis framework was developed as the analysis framework for the MaRS project, to standardizing the workflow for the identification both known and new polymorphisms in P.falciparum genes associated with drug resistance.
