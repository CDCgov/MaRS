# Introduction #


<a id="Background"></a>

## Background ##

Text to introduce the rationale of where things are and what this folder (workflow step) does. What kinds of outputs are generated



<a id="OtherItem"></a>

## Other Item ##

This could be where we list what is needed to do the work in this folder (workflow step).

# Protocol #

We outline which file to use, what are the inputs, and what parts of the Jupyter code need to be run.
Easy to highlight (will do this in the Jupyter code too) how there will be two sections. One section is for summarizing and outputing the two Excel files. The other section is for visualization.

## Next Steps ##

List out that once this is done, what remains is to submit the samples to NCBI, so go do those steps next.
We can make additional sections to describe any other items... maybe known issues or other things to consider.

For example, a section that describes the contents of the VariantsOfInterest.csv file. Mention how it goes hand in hand with the TrackerSNPs track in the reference genes file.
