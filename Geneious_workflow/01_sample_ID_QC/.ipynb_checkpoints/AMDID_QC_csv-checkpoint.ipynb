    "CDC Malaria Next generation Sequancing lab generates sample ID which is called AMD ID, is 20 character long and have specific meta data attched to it which makes it easier to standerdize the sample name and tracking. It also makes it convenient to submit the samples to NCBI as it requires to submit associated meta data (attributes)submitted with each fastq record.\n",
