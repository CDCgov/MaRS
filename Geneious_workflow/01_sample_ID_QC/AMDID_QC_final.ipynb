    "\n",
    "A standardized sample naming schema is used to capture all associated meta-data prior to sequencing. Briefly, the AMD ID consist of 20 characters that capture information like collection year, geographical and treatment information, sample type and molecular markers included for each sample. Please see: MS Teams > SOP-Lab > [01_Sample_Naming](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/files/SOPs%20-%20Lab?threadId=19%3Affc4c3a207f14a40a89607153ba81e66%40thread.skype&ctx=channel&context=01_Sample%2520Naming&rootfolder=%252Fteams%252FCGH-DPDM-AMD%252FShared%2520Documents%252FSOPs%2520-%2520Lab%252F01_Sample%2520Naming) directory for more information. Capturing this information at the pre-processing stage reduces the need to have multiple documents with this information, removing potential for mislabeling or tracking errors, and provides the bioiformatics team  with sufficient information to perform subsequent analysis and standardize analysis pipelines, including submission of data to NCBI. \n",

    "* The AMD ID Key:  `<year> <country> <state/site> <day of failure> <treatment> <sample_id> <genus spp> <sample type> <mol marker bit code> <# sample processed>`. \n",
