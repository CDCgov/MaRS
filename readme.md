## MaRS (Malaria Resistance Surveillance) Project :rocket: ##

### Vision ###

#### Disrupt the way :microscope: :computer: science is done and in the process save lives. #####

### Background ###
The emergence of resistance to all currently available antimalarial drugs in multiple regions of the world represents a global public health challenge. In order to monitor and address this situation, faster and more effective surveillance tools are required to track and monitor the emergence and evolution of drug resistance in malaria. The Malaria Resistance Surveillance (MaRS) project aims to address this challenge by collating and mapping genetic polymorphisms associated with drug resistance in _P. falciparum_ malaria around the world.

Data for this project is generated using a targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) approach in an effort to collect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on all currently known drug resistance associated malaria genes from travelers returning to the US from overseas, as well as samples actively collected in collaboration with partners from other countries.

This projects aims to:
* :white_check_mark: Share all our laboratory and analysis protocols publicly
* :white_check_mark: Transfer these methods where they are most needed (malaria endemic countries)
* :white_check_mark: Standardize the entire process, from sample collection to report generation  

### Lab Protocols :microscope: ###

Please see the Illumina TADS [Lab Protocol](https://github.com/CDCgov/MaRS/blob/master/SOPs/MaRSsop.md) for the most up to date standard operating procedures (SOPs).

### Data Analysis :computer: ###

Two analysis workflows are available and actively being developed:  
* [Beginner/Intermediate Bioinformaticans and Biologists](https://github.com/CDCgov/MaRS/blob/master/Geneious_workflow/readme.md)
* [Advanced Bioinformaticans and Data Scientists](https://github.com/CDCgov/MaRS/blob/master/Nextflow_workflow/readme.md)

### Data Sharing ###

Data for this project can be found at the following link [NCBI BioProject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA428490). Collaborators are encouraged to submit their own data using the same [NCBI BioProject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA428490)
